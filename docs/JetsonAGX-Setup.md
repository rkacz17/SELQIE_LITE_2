## Install Software

ssh selqie@<ip address>
```

### 2. Update and Upgrade

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

### 3. Generate SSH Key on the Jetson
1. [Generate new SSH Key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
2. [Add SSH Key to Github](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

### 4. Install SELQIE Repository
```
mkdir ~/selqie_ws
git clone git@github.com:FAMU-FSU-STRIDe/selqie ~/selqie_ws/src
```

### 5. Run Installation Bash Script
```
cd ~/selqie_ws/src/tools && ./install.sh
```

- When adding new software, make sure to add the installation commands to this script

### Troubleshooting
I ran into an issue with OpenCV, where versions 4.5 and 4.8 were installed causing conflicts. This gave errors when trying to run the camera disparity nodes.

Solution:
```
sudo apt purge *libopencv*
sudo apt remove opencv-licenses
sudo apt install libopencv-dev=4.5.*
sudo apt-mark hold libopencv-dev
```
Then re-run the install script
